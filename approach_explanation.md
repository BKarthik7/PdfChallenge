# PDF Intelligence System - Technical Approach

## Overview

Our solution implements a two-stage PDF intelligence system designed to extract structured information and provide persona-driven analysis for document collections. The approach emphasizes accuracy, performance, and offline operation while meeting strict computational constraints.

## Round 1A: PDF Structure Extraction

### Title Extraction Strategy
We employ a multi-layered approach for title detection:

1. **Metadata Priority**: First check PDF metadata for embedded title information
2. **Content Analysis**: Analyze first page text using font size, position, and formatting heuristics
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify title-like characteristics (large fonts, top positioning, capitalization patterns)
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Use filename as last resort with intelligent cleaning

### Heading Detection Algorithm
Our heading extraction combines multiple techniques:

1. **Table of Contents Parsing**: Extract structured headings from PDF TOC when available
2. **Font-Based Analysis**: Analyze font sizes across the document to identify heading hierarchies
3. **Pattern Matching**: Use regex patterns to identify numbered sections, chapters, and formatted headings
4. **Context Filtering**: Remove false positives like page numbers, figure captions, and email addresses

The algorithm dynamically determines heading thresholds by analyzing font size distributions, ensuring adaptability across different document styles.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming Processing**: Process pages incrementally to manage memory usage
- **Early Termination**: Stop processing when heading patterns are established
- **Efficient Text Extraction**: Use PyMuPDF's optimized text extraction methods
- **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Release document objects promptly after processing

## Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

### Content Extraction Architecture
We extract and organize content at multiple granularities:

1. **Page-Level Organization**: Maintain document structure with page boundaries
2. **Section Identification**: Use pattern-based detection for document sections
3. **Formatting Preservation**: Retain font, size, and layout information for context
4. **Metadata Integration**: Include images, tables, and structural elements

### Relevance Scoring Framework
Our multi-dimensional relevance scoring considers:

**Token Overlap Scoring (30% weight)**:
- Jaccard similarity between text and persona keywords
- Coverage percentage of persona-specific terms
- Stemming and lemmatization for better matching

**Job Alignment Scoring (40% weight)**:
- Direct keyword matching with job requirements
- Semantic similarity using term frequency analysis
- Context-aware scoring for job-specific terminology

**TF-IDF Weighting (20% weight)**:
- Term frequency within document sections
- Inverse document frequency approximation
- Boost for rare but relevant terms

**Domain Relevance (10% weight)**:
- Predefined keyword sets for different domains (research, business, technical)
- Dynamic keyword extraction from persona descriptions
- Context-sensitive scoring based on field-specific terminology

### Section Ranking and Selection
1. **Hierarchical Processing**: Analyze documents at section and subsection levels
2. **Relevance Aggregation**: Combine multiple scoring dimensions with weighted averages
3. **Diversity Optimization**: Ensure coverage across different document types and sections
4. **Quality Filtering**: Remove low-quality or duplicate sections

### Text Refinement Process
For selected sections, we apply:
- **Sentence-Level Scoring**: Rank individual sentences by relevance
- **Extractive Summarization**: Select most relevant sentences while maintaining coherence
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain logical flow and readability
- **Length Optimization**: Balance information density with readability

## Technical Implementation Details

### PDF Processing Pipeline
1. **Document Validation**: Check file integrity and format compatibility
2. **Content Extraction**: Use PyMuPDF for robust text and metadata extraction
3. **Structure Analysis**: Identify document layout and formatting patterns
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle corrupted or malformed PDF elements gracefully

### NLP Processing Components
- **Tokenization**: Clean text processing with stop word removal
- **Normalization**: Handle various text encodings and formatting inconsistencies
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identify important terms using statistical methods
- **Similarity Computation**: Efficient text comparison algorithms

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Management**: Stream processing for large documents
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple CPU cores where possible
- **Caching**: Store intermediate results to avoid recomputation
- **Algorithm Complexity**: O(n log n) or better for all major operations

## Scalability and Robustness

### Multi-language Support
- Unicode text handling for global document support
- Language-agnostic pattern recognition
- Extensible keyword sets for different languages

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing when individual pages fail
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Verify output quality at each stage
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error reporting for debugging

### Quality Assurance
- **Output Validation**: JSON schema compliance checking
- **Relevance Verification**: Sanity checks for scoring algorithms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time and memory usage tracking
- **Regression Testing**: Validation against known good outputs

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models for better heading detection and relevance scoring
2. **Advanced NLP**: Incorporate semantic embeddings and transformer models
3. **Layout Analysis**: Enhanced table and figure detection
4. **Multi-modal Processing**: Integration of image and chart content
5. **Personalization**: Adaptive algorithms that learn from user feedback

This approach balances accuracy, performance, and maintainability while meeting the strict constraints of the hackathon challenge. The modular design allows for easy extension and improvement of individual components.
