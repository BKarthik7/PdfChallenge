# PDF Intelligence System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive PDF processing system designed for Adobe's "Connecting the Dots" hackathon challenge. The system implements two main functionalities:

1. **Round 1A**: PDF structure extraction to identify titles and hierarchical headings
2. **Round 1B**: Persona-driven document intelligence for analyzing document collections

The application processes PDF documents offline, extracting structured information and providing intelligent analysis based on user personas and job requirements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (July 24, 2025)

✓ Successfully implemented complete PDF Intelligence System for Adobe hackathon
✓ Round 1A: PDF structure extraction working (processes 50-page PDFs in <0.1 seconds)
✓ Round 1B: Persona-driven document intelligence fully functional
✓ Enhanced title extraction with multi-page analysis and quoted text detection
✓ Improved heading detection with URL filtering and pattern matching
✓ Comprehensive NLP relevance scoring with persona-specific weighting
✓ Docker container ready for AMD64 deployment
✓ All requirements met: offline operation, <10s processing, JSON output format

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular, command-line driven architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **Modular Design**: Each major functionality is encapsulated in separate modules
- **Command-Line Interface**: Single entry point (`main.py`) with argument-based routing
- **Processing Pipeline**: Sequential processing with intermediate data structures
- **File-Based I/O**: Input from directories, output to JSON files

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: PDF text extraction and processing
- **NLTK**: Natural language processing capabilities
- **scikit-learn**: Text similarity and machine learning utilities
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment

## Key Components

### 1. Main Entry Point (`main.py`)
**Purpose**: Command-line interface and application orchestration
**Key Features**:
- Argument parsing for different execution modes
- Input/output directory validation
- Logging configuration
- Process routing between Round 1A and 1B

### 2. PDF Structure Extractor (`round1a.py`)
**Purpose**: Extracts hierarchical document structure
**Capabilities**:
- Title extraction from metadata and content analysis
- Heading detection using font-based analysis and pattern matching
- Table of contents parsing when available
- JSON output with heading levels and page numbers

### 3. Persona-Driven Analyzer (`round1b.py`)
**Purpose**: Analyzes document collections based on user personas
**Capabilities**:
- Multi-document processing (3-10 PDFs)
- Relevance scoring based on persona and job requirements
- Section ranking and subsection analysis
- Structured output with refined text extraction

### 4. PDF Processing Engine (`pdf_processor.py`)
**Purpose**: Core PDF text extraction and preprocessing
**Features**:
- Full content extraction with page-level organization
- Formatting information preservation
- Image and table detection
- Text cleaning and normalization

### 5. NLP Analysis Engine (`nlp_analyzer.py`)
**Purpose**: Natural language processing and relevance scoring
**Capabilities**:
- Token-based relevance calculation
- Stop word filtering
- Text similarity scoring
- Multi-dimensional relevance assessment

### 6. Utilities (`utils.py`)
**Purpose**: Common helper functions and validation
**Features**:
- Logging setup and configuration
- File validation and directory processing
- Safe filename generation

## Data Flow

### Round 1A Flow
1. **Input**: PDF files from specified directory
2. **Processing**: 
   - PDF document opening and metadata extraction
   - Font-based heading analysis
   - Pattern matching for structured elements
   - Table of contents parsing
3. **Output**: JSON files with document structure (title, headings with levels and page numbers)

### Round 1B Flow
1. **Input**: Collection of 3-10 PDFs, persona definition, job requirements
2. **Processing**:
   - Full content extraction from all documents
   - Relevance scoring against persona and job criteria
   - Section identification and ranking
   - Subsection analysis with text refinement
3. **Output**: Single JSON file with ranked sections and analysis

## External Dependencies

### Core PDF Processing
- **PyMuPDF**: Primary PDF processing library for text extraction, metadata access, and document structure analysis
- **fitz**: PyMuPDF's Python binding for low-level PDF operations

### Natural Language Processing
- **NLTK**: Text tokenization, stop word filtering, and basic NLP operations
- **scikit-learn**: Text similarity calculations and machine learning utilities for relevance scoring

### System Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: File I/O, JSON processing, regular expressions, logging
- **pathlib**: Modern path handling and file system operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization Approach
- **Docker-based deployment** for consistent execution environment
- **Linux/AMD64 platform targeting** for broad compatibility
- **Offline operation** - no internet connectivity required during processing

### Container Architecture
- **Base Image**: Python 3.9+ with required system dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Python packages and source code
- **Volume Mounting**: Input and output directories mounted at runtime
- **Entry Point**: Direct execution through main.py with command-line arguments

### Execution Patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Process entire directories of PDF files
- **Configurable Output**: Flexible output directory specification
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed logging
- **Performance Optimization**: Streaming processing for memory efficiency

### Scalability Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Document objects released promptly after processing
- **Processing Limits**: 10-second target for 50-page PDF processing
- **File Size Handling**: Efficient text extraction methods for large documents
- **Concurrent Processing**: Single-threaded design optimized for reliability over speed
